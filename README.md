# Tool for generating OSD for Walksnail DVR

That's easy, drag and drop files into UI, click Generate.
Then import generated sequence into and video editing software and adjust framerate to 60fps if needed.

# How to run

### Windows
Nothing to do, Go to [Release page](https://github.com/kirek007/ws-osd-py/releases)

### Linux / MacOS

Disclamer: I've tried my best to make it work on all systems, but it's only tested on Windows. So it might not work as expected 
on other systems.

**Only works with Python 3.10 due to issues with wxPython and python-opencv libs**

Install ffmpeg:

For Linux:
```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg 
```

For MacOs:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

Then clone respotiory and run app

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirek007/ws-osd-py.git
cd ws-osd-py
make run
```
